# ProjectBlocksDistance

The purpose of the project is to find the maximum possible distance of two figures that can find the best initial block to start from and then jump to left/right only upwards or at the same level height. Blocks are defined as integers (height) in a given array "blocks" (blocks placed next to eachother)

The prinzipal functionality of the application is to move through the given array "blocks", checking the maximum possible distance the two figures can achieve, starting from each block. In the end the program will check for the maximum possible distance that has been calculated and prints it to the console.

(Further projects will be uploaded soon)
